## PASSWORD GENERATOR :
* using useCallback( ) , useEffect( ), useRef( )
### useCallback( ):
* Imagine you have a toy box, and you keep getting the same toy out every time you play. You don't want to search for it again and again. Instead, you remember exactly where you put it last time so you can get it quickly next time. This saves time and effort 
* React does the same , it remembers the function so that it doesn't create it from scratch every time your component updates. This can make your project faster.
* useCallback( ) stores  frequent using functions in cache memory for future use.
### useEffect()
