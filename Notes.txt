* React make it's DOM called = Virtual DOM.
TODO BEST PRACTICES:
* file name = Capital first alphabet
* file extension = .jsx
* function name = Capital file alphabet


? CREATION OF REACT FILE WITH VITE:
* command in terminal = npm create vite@latest.
? INSTALL IMPORTANT MODULES:
* npm install / inside that particular folder.
? RUN FILE:
* npm run dev



? INJECT REACT WITH HTML:
*  Browser only know html and css language, and as we did inject javascript code in html file using "<script>" tag 
* we also need to inject react code file in html and css page file we will learn how....


? MAKING FUNCTION WHICH RETURN HTML ELEMENTS:
* always name them with first upper case alphabet like Add , Sum , Mul  ....more
* Vite need file extension to be jsx and not js / some vite configurations need to be followed
* in Jsx you can only return one element at the time that's why <> inside the fragment elements to be returned should be placed

! here you can't return more than one tag , whatever you want to be between < > closing tags and nothing else.
function App() {
  return (
       <h1>Harshita</h1>   
      <Playing/> //for this i have to import playing in App.jsx too
  )
}
